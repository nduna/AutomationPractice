### Safety Testing:

#### Test Case 1: Lid Adjustment Safety

Steps:

- Fill the kettle with 500ml of water and turn it on.
- Observe if the lid adjusts to the 750ml mark (half the water volume).

Expected Result: The lid should adjust to the 750ml mark.

#### Test Case 2: Element Activation Safety

Steps:

- Fill the kettle with less than 250ml of water (less than one cup).
- Turn on the kettle and observe if the element activates.

Expected Result: The element should not activate for water below 250ml.

#### Test Case 3: Overheat Safety

Steps:

- Fill the kettle with water and turn it on until it reaches 110 degrees Celsius.
- Observe if the kettle switches off and triggers the lid release air.

Expected Result: The kettle should switch off and trigger the lid release air at 110 degrees Celsius.

#### Test Case 4: Temperature Maintenance Safety

Steps:

- Fill the kettle with water and turn it on until it reaches 110 degrees Celsius.
- Let the water cool down to 95 degrees Celsius.
- Observe if the lid valve closes to maintain the temperature above 90 degrees Celsius for up to 45 minutes.

Expected Result: The lid valve should close and maintain the temperature above 90 degrees Celsius for up to 45 minutes.

### Function Testing:

#### Test Case 1: Lid Adjustment Function

Steps:

- Fill the kettle with various water levels (e.g., 200ml, 500ml, 800ml) and turn it on.
- Observe if the lid adjusts to the appropriate level (half the water volume).

Expected Result: The lid should adjust correctly based on the water volume.

### Efficiency Testing:

#### Test Case 1: Boiling Time Efficiency

Steps:

- Fill the kettle with a specific volume of water (e.g., 500ml) and turn it on.
- Measure the time it takes for the water to reach boiling point.

Expected Result: The kettle should achieve boiling point within a reasonable time.

#### Test Case 2: Temperature Maintenance Efficiency

Steps:

- Fill the kettle with water and turn it on until it reaches 110 degrees Celsius.
- Measure the time it takes for the water to cool down to 95 degrees Celsius and the lid valve to close.
- Measure the time the lid valve maintains the temperature above 90 degrees Celsius.

Expected Result: The kettle should efficiently maintain the temperature above 90 degrees Celsius for up to 45 minutes.
